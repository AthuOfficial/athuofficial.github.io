## A letter to my Grandpa on his 90th Birth anniversary



Dear Anna,

Well I don't know how to start writing this. Today marks 6 months since you left us and it is also your 90th Birthday.

Writing one fond memory of you when I have lived most of my life with you and Aai is perhaps the most difficult thing to do. Now that I think retrospectively, I realise, all my life I have spent more time with you than with my parents.

For me the oldest memory I can think off is spending the hot summers with you and Aai in Aurangabad. I remember how we travelled in train, I remember how you put me to bed on the middle berth. I remember how you tied a rope around the berth so I won't fall off.

During my childhood I remember Pappa used to ask me, who is the one person you fear the most in our family? More often than not, my answer used to be You. That is how your personality was. It instilled fear. It commanded respect.

Over the years, my equation with you changed a lot. From the person I used to fear the most to a joyful retired grandfather who was always keen to do something for me. Starting from cooking my favourite dishes for me to giving me some outrageous gifts.

Over the years, your personality changed a lot as well. From venerable Dr.V.N.Kulkarni of MGM medical college to quite a mellow character especially towards me. After I moved to Vellore, and now to Dallas, our communication whittled down reason being your problems with listening. But I clearly remember you asking me one question always. "Jevan zhala ka?". After that you used to pass the phone to Aai and she used to talk with me. As always, this was backseat driving. Aai used to ask all the questions hyou wanted to ask. Once the call is done, you both used to have their cute little summary of the call. Sometimes the call used to stay connected and listening to your conversation was one of the funniest things. Sorry for intruding your privacy with your Saheb. I am sure you won't mind.

I think I can call myself the luckiest of all to experience and taste all the dishes you made. I can go in detail and talk about how every dish you made was special but I am not going to do that. Although I'll count myself lucky that I was able to eat Kachori made by you as recent as January 2020.

As witty your personality was, I have one story about you which I want to tell you and everyone reading this. It is very close to my heart. You were admitted in the hospital around the time I had to leave for Dallas. Everyday you used to ask the Doctor, when am I getting discharged. You wanted to be home before I left. Unfortunately, that didn't pan out. I said my last goodbye to you at the hospital. Once I was gone, you stopped asking the doctor when am I going home? When the doctor asked you why have you stopped asking you just replied "Aata Atharva gela aahe, Mi ikde ek mahina hi rahu shakto kahich problem nahi."

Teaching you how to use the smart phone was one of my guilty pleasures. We as a young generation take some things for granted especially related to technology. But all was not easy for an 80 year old man like yourself. But as smart you were, you picked up things pretty quickly and mastered them. Before leaving for Dallas, you said to me, "April madhe 4G pack samptoy, recharge karshil". Since you left us in February this line really saddens me but also makes me appreciate the positive outlook you had towards life.

When you left us on 11th February 2020, we lost a gem of a person and you left a very huge void to fill. The only way to try and fill this void is by following what you did. Maintaining relationships like you did. Helping others like you. Living life like you did. Today, as we mourn over your 6 month death anniversary and your 90th birth anniversary, I promise you from that tomorrow onwards we will celebrate your life and carry this great legacy forward.

I still remember one thing you asked for me to do before I left for Dallas. I promised you I will do it and believe me when I say, I am working hard towards achieving it.

Yours loving,

-Pillu(As you used to call me affectionately)

I want say something to everyone reading this. I don't think I am credible enough to say this but I am still going to. As inspiring Anna's personality was, I want everyone to learn something from it. This is the way we carry forward his legacy. 

Remember how he never stopped learning. Remember how he never stopped husling. Remember how he thought us that age is no limit to learn. Keep on learning. Never stop. Remember how respectfully he lived his life. Remember how even after retirement he didn't stop working. Remember how while doing all this, he never stopped helping his wife in the kitchen. Remember how he kept maintaining all the relations. Remember how he helped anyone selflessly when needed. And most importantly, Remember how he never stopped enjoying his life.

Dear Anna, we all miss you but we all know you are in a better place. Wish you a very HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

Thank you all for taking time to read this. I hope you like it.
